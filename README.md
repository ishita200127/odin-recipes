# Odin Recipes

This project is part of *The Odin Project* foundations course. Its purpose is to create a simple multi-page recipe website using only HTML. The project focuses on structuring content, linking pages, and organizing files in a clean and readable way.

## What This Project Is About

The website includes:

- An `index.html` homepage listing links to several recipes  
- Individual recipe pages containing:
  - A title  
  - An ingredients list  
  - Step-by-step instructions  
  - A link back to the homepage  

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I practiced:

- Writing valid, semantic HTML  
- Using headings, ordered/unordered lists, and anchor tags  
- Creating internal links using relative file paths  
- Organizing project folders and files  
- Building and testing a simple multi-page website  

## Reflection

### What I Learned
Through this project, I learned how to structure a basic multi-page website using only HTML. I practiced creating links between pages using relative paths, organizing files into folders, and using headings and lists in a more semantic way. I also gained confidence in understanding how a browser reads and renders simple HTML documents.

### What I Found Challenging
The most challenging part was keeping the file paths consistent and ensuring that every link pointed to the correct location—especially when working inside a `recipes` subfolder. Another challenge was maintaining clean, consistent formatting across all recipe pages so the site felt uniform. Small mistakes like incorrect tags (`l1` instead of `li`) also reminded me to pay close attention to detail.

### What I Would Improve or Expand in the Future
In the future, I would like to add images to each recipe page, improve the visual design with CSS, and enhance accessibility by using more semantic HTML elements. I could also expand the site by adding more recipes, a navigation bar, and possibly categories for different types of dishes. Eventually, styling the website with a responsive layout would make it feel more polished and usable.
